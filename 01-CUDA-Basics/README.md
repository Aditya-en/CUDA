# CUDA Programming Model

## Introduction

CUDA C++ extends C++ by introducing the concept of kernels - functions that execute in parallel across multiple CUDA threads. This document outlines the key concepts of the CUDA programming model.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Kernels

- Defined using the `__global__` declaration specifier
- Launched using the `<<<...>>>` syntax, specifying the number of threads
- Each thread executes the kernel once

Example:

```cpp
__global__ void myKernel(int* data) {
    // Kernel code here
}

// Kernel launch
myKernel<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_data);
```

### 2. Thread Hierarchy

Threads are organized into a two-level hierarchy:

a. Thread Blocks: 1D, 2D, or 3D groups of threads
b. Grid: 1D, 2D, or 3D arrangement of blocks

This structure allows efficient mapping of threads to data elements in vectors, matrices, or volumes.

### 3. Thread Identification

CUDA provides built-in variables to identify threads:

- `threadIdx`: 3D vector identifying a thread within its block
- `blockIdx`: 3D vector identifying a block within the grid
- `blockDim`: 3D vector specifying the dimensions of each block
- `gridDim`: 3D vector specifying the dimensions of the grid

### 4. Indexing Example

For a 2D grid of 2D blocks:

```cpp
int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
int index = y * gridDim.x * blockDim.x + x;
```

## Memory Hierarchy

CUDA devices have several memory spaces:

1. Global Memory: Accessible by all threads, but slow
2. Shared Memory: Fast, shared within a block
3. Local Memory: Private to each thread
4. Constant Memory: Read-only, cached for fast access
5. Texture Memory: Optimized for 2D spatial locality

Understanding and utilizing these memory spaces effectively is crucial for optimizing CUDA performance.

## Synchronization

- `__syncthreads()`: Synchronizes all threads within a block
- No built-in synchronization between blocks; must use separate kernel launches or atomic operations

## Best Practices

1. Maximize occupancy: Balance thread count and resource usage
2. Minimize data transfer between host and device
3. Use shared memory for frequently accessed data
4. Coalesce global memory accesses
5. Avoid divergent branching within warps

## Conclusion

Mastering the CUDA programming model involves understanding thread hierarchy, memory management, and synchronization. With practice, you can harness the power of GPU parallelism for a wide range of computational tasks.
